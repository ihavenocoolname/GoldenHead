"Abortive attempt to collect and display fitness data. Uses the Google Fitness API, written in Java."

My original project as proposed was too large in scope given time constraints, and needed constant revisions and reworkings this proved a poor use of my time.


Initially the fitness data was only meant to be a small part of the total project. 
Project was originally conceived to be an in-browser information dashboard, displaying useful data about user's habits, and to 
output suggestions for improving said habits. Originally, this would have included phonecall history, fitness history, and (hopefully)
highlight free spaces in th user's calendar for rectifying shortcomings in expected phonecall and fitness goals.

I generated a client id and secret in order to access a user's fitness data stored on Google's servers, which would then be displayed
within a Java applet. This proved stressful for a beginner Java programmer such as myself, so I decided to work within the constraints
of my abilities, and code this within Android Studio, thereby bypassing the need to spend my limited time learning how to implement OAuth



As of initial commit, due to spending too much time deciding the best way to progress, I have not yet successfully added any way for the 
data pulled to be displayed to the user, or indeed, have anything at all done to or with said data. Project as it stands is an 
Android App that displays 5 buttons, and has a lot of useles code. Even the inclusion of 5 buttons was me pushing myself to do
too much in too little time with too little knowledge an ability.

It does successfully request that I choose an account to use with the app, so there is that.

Debugging both within an emulator and Nexus device proved challenging given my environment's limited RAM and its x64 AMD processor, 
so I was mostly either staring at unresponsive windows, or coding in the dark and hoping for the best. Given this was my first attempt
at using Android studio outside of a classroom environment, this project served more as a crash course in how to debug than its 
actual intent. Being to make a funcional Java app.

In future revisions, I intend to make this functional. How's that for a lofty goal?
